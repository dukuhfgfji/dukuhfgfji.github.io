## About Me

I received the B.Eng. degree in Mechatronics and Automation from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2022.

I am currently pursuing the M.S. degree in Control Science and Engineering in the Fast Lab (Fire Group) at Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, under the guidance of <a href="http://zju-fast.com/research-group/yanjun-cao/" target="_blank">Yanjun Cao</a>.

I am applying for a PhD.
If you're interested in discussing my work or potential collaborations, feel free to email me at zhehanli66@gmail.com
